# Cellular-Conundrum-WebGL
A project I created for my Biology Honors class. Explains how parts of the cell work in an interactive game, using the Unity engine<br />
<br />
**This is not source code. This is a built version of the game to run in web browsers.**<br />
<br />
The playable game can be found at: https://luddo183.github.io/Cellular-Conundrum-WebGL/
